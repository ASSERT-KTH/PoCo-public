The pausing mechanism of PhiNFT1155 contract is implemented incorrectly and doesn't work. Users are still able to transfer NFTs in paused state.
Summary

Contract PhiNFT1155 inherits from the following parent contracts:
contract PhiNFT1155 is
    Initializable,
    UUPSUpgradeable,
    ERC1155SupplyUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    Ownable2StepUpgradeable,
    IPhiNFT1155,
    Claimable,
    CreatorRoyaltiesControl
{

The problem with the above is that inheriting from PausableUpgradeable is not effective in the scope of OZ ERC1155 contracts. As a result, users are able to transfer NFT tokens even when the contract is paused, as the below PoC demonstrates.
