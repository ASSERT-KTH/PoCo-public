Private Pools support NFT borrowing using flash loans. Users that decide to use this feature have to pay a flash loan fee to the owner of the pool.

The contract has a changeFee variable that is used to configure the fee for changing NFTs, and this variable is also used to determine the fee for flash loans. In the case of a change operation, the value is interpreted as an amount with 4 decimals, and the token is the base token of the pool. This means that, for example, if the base token is ETH, a changeFee value of 25 should be interpreted as a fee of 0.0025 ETH for change operation.

However, as we can see in this following snippet, the flashFee function just returns the value of changeFee without any scaling or modification.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/PrivatePool.sol#L750-L752
750:     function flashFee(address, uint256) public view returns (uint256) {
751:         return changeFee;
752:     }

This means that, following the previous example, a changeFee value of 25 will result in 0.0025 ETH for change operation, but just 25 wei for flash loans.

The documentation hints that this value should also be scaled to 4 decimals in the case of the flash loan fee, but in any case this is clearly an incorrect setting of the flash loan fee.
