When users withdraw their strike escrowed in Putty contract, Putty will charge a certain amount of fee from the strike amount. The fee will first be sent to the contract owner, and the remaining strike amount will then be sent to the users.

function withdraw(Order memory order) public {
	..SNIP..
​
	// transfer strike to owner if put is expired or call is exercised
	if ((order.isCall && isExercised) || (!order.isCall && !isExercised)) {
		// send the fee to the admin/DAO if fee is greater than 0%
		uint256 feeAmount = 0;
		if (fee > 0) {
			feeAmount = (order.strike * fee) / 1000;
			ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(owner(), feeAmount);
		}
​
		ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(msg.sender, order.strike - feeAmount);
​
		return;
	}
	..SNIP..
}

There are two methods on how the owner can deny user from withdrawing their strike amount from the contract
