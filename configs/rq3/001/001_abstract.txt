The multicall function in the Size.sol contract does not work as intended. The intention of the multicall function is to allow users to access multiple functionalities of the Size protocol, such as a (deposit and repay) pair, by a single transaction. The multicall function allows batch processing of multiple interactions with the protocol in a single transaction, which also allows users to take actions that would otherwise be denied due to deposit limits.
