Royalty fee calculation has a serious flaw in buy(...). Caviar's private pools could be completely drained.

In the Caviar private pool, NFT royalties are being paid from the msg.sender to the NFT royalty receiver of each token in PrivatePool.buy and PrivatePool.sell:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/PrivatePool.sol#L271-L285

        #buy(uint256[],uint256[],MerkleMultiProof)

271:    if (payRoyalties) {
            ...
274:        (uint256 royaltyFee, address recipient) = _getRoyalty(tokenIds[i], salePrice);
            ...
278:        if (baseToken != address(0)) {
279:            ERC20(baseToken).safeTransfer(recipient, royaltyFee);
280:        } else {
281:            recipient.safeTransferETH(royaltyFee);
282:        }

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/PrivatePool.sol#L328-L352

        #sell(uint256[],uint256[],MerkleMultiProof,IStolenNftOracle.Message[])

329:    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds.length; i++) {
            ...
333:        if (payRoyalties) {
                ...
338:            (uint256 royaltyFee, address recipient) = _getRoyalty(tokenIds[i], salePrice);
                ...
345:            if (baseToken != address(0)) {
346:                ERC20(baseToken).safeTransfer(recipient, royaltyFee);
347:            } else {
348:                recipient.safeTransferETH(royaltyFee);
349:            }

In both functions, the amount needed to pay all royalties is taken from the msg.sender who is either the buyer or the seller depending on the context. In PrivatePool.sell, this amount is first paid by the pool and then taken from the msg.sender by simply reducing what they receive in return for the NFTs they are selling. A similar thing is done in PrivatePool.buy, but instead of reducing the output amount, the input amount of base tokens that the msg.sender (buyer) should pay to the pool is increased:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/PrivatePool.sol#L251-L252

        #buy(uint256[],uint256[],MerkleMultiProof)

251:    // add the royalty fee amount to the net input aount
252:    netInputAmount += royaltyFeeAmount;

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/PrivatePool.sol#L354-L355

        #sell(uint256[],uint256[],MerkleMultiProof,IStolenNftOracle.Message[])

354:    // subtract the royalty fee amount from the net output amount
355:    netOutputAmount -= royaltyFeeAmount;

The difference between these two functions (that lies at the core of the problem) is that in PrivatePool.buy, the _getRoyalty function is called twice. The first time is to calculate the total amount of royalties to be paid, and the second time is to actually send each royalty fee to each recipient:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/PrivatePool.sol#L242-L248
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/PrivatePool.sol#L273-L274

        #buy(uint256[],uint256[],MerkleMultiProof)

242:    if (payRoyalties) {
243:        // get the royalty fee for the NFT
244:        (uint256 royaltyFee,) = _getRoyalty(tokenIds[i], salePrice); // @audit _getRoyalty called 1st time
245:
246:        // add the royalty fee to the total royalty fee amount
247:        royaltyFeeAmount += royaltyFee;
248:    }
        
        ...
        
273:    // get the royalty fee for the NFT
274:    (uint256 royaltyFee, address recipient) = _getRoyalty(tokenIds[i], salePrice); // @audit  _getRoyalty called 2nd time

This is problematic because an attacker could potentially change the royalty fee between the two calls, due to the following untrusted external call:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/PrivatePool.sol#L267-L268

        #buy(uint256[],uint256[],MerkleMultiProof)

267:    // refund any excess ETH to the caller
268:    if (msg.value > netInputAmount) msg.sender.safeTransferETH(msg.value - netInputAmount); // @audit untrusted external call

If the msg.sender is a malicious contract that has control over the royaltyFee for the NFTs that are being bought, they can change it, for example, from 0 basis points (0%) to 10000 basis points (100%) in their receive() function.

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/common/ERC2981.sol#L94-L99

        // @audit An attacker can call this setter function between the two `_getRoyalty()` calls.
94:     function _setTokenRoyalty(uint256 tokenId, address receiver, uint96 feeNumerator) internal virtual {
95:         require(feeNumerator <= _feeDenominator(), "ERC2981: royalty fee will exceed salePrice");
96:         require(receiver != address(0), "ERC2981: Invalid parameters");
97:
98:         _tokenRoyaltyInfo[tokenId] = RoyaltyInfo(receiver, feeNumerator);
99:     }

That way, the amount transferred by the msg.sender for royalties will be 0 because the total royaltyFeeAmount is calculated based on the first value (0%) but the actual sent amount to the receiver is determined by the second value (100%). This will result in the whole price paid for the NFT being returned to the royalty receiver, but being paid by the Pool instead of the msg.sender.

The msg.sender has therefore received the NFT but paid the whole price for it to the royalty receiver and 0 to the Pool. If the msg.sender is the royalty receiver, they will basically have spent 0 base tokens (not counting gas expenses) but received the NFT in their account. They can then sell it to the same private pool to exchange it for base tokens.

This is an extreme scenario, however, the developers have acknowledged ERC-2981 and that royaltyInfo(...) returns an arbitrary address. In the future we could see projects that have royalty payments that fluctuate such as increasing/decaying royalties over time article on eip 2981 or projects that delegate the creation of nfts to the users such as 1024pixels polygon, git repo and royalties are paid to each user rather to a single creator. In such cases invocation of _getRoyalty(...) twice with external calls that transfer assets in-between is a vulnerable pattern that is sure to introduce asset risks and calculation inaccuracies both for the users and protocol itself. Immediate remedy would be to simplify buy(...) in PrivatePool.sol to use only one for loop and call _getRoyalty(...) once.
