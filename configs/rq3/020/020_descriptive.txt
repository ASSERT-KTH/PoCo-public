The smart contract contains a critical vulnerability that allows a malicious actor to manipulate the share price during the initialization of the liquidity pool, potentially leading to a DOS attack on subsequent buyShares operations.
Vulnerability Detail

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the initialization process of the liquidity pool, specifically in the calculation of shares during the first deposit.
// Findings are labeled with '<= FOUND'
// File: dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSPFunding.sol
31:    function buyShares(address to)
        ...
57:            // case 1. initial supply
58:            // The shares will be minted to user
59:            shares = quoteBalance < DecimalMath.mulFloor(baseBalance, _I_) // <= FOUND
60:                ? DecimalMath.divFloor(quoteBalance, _I_)
61:                : baseBalance; // @audit-info mint shares based on min balance(base, quote)
62:            // The target will be updated
63:            _BASE_TARGET_ = uint112(shares);
            ...
82:    }

If the pool is empty, the smart contract directly sets the share value based on the minimium value of the base token denominated value of the provided assets. This assumption can be manipulated by a malicious actor during the first deposit, leading to a situation where the LP pool token becomes extremely expensive.
