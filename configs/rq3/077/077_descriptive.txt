When a fighting round ends, winners for the current round get picked and allocated respective rewards. These rewards are fighter NFTs that can be claimed by such winners. When you claim your rewards for a round or several rounds, the numRoundsClaimed state variable which stores the number of rounds you've claimed for gets updated to reflect your claim and each winner can only ever claim up to the amounts they win for each given round. That means if you try to batch-claim for two given rounds for which you won 2 fighter NFTs, your NFT count after the claim should be whatever your current balance of NFT is plus 2 fighter NFTs.

The issue here is that there's a way to mint additional fighter NFTs on top of the fighter NFTs you're owed for winning even though the claimRewards function has implemented a decent system to prevent over-claims. For one, it's relatively complex to spoof a call pretending to be the _mergingPoolAddress to mint but a malicious user doesn't need to worry too much about that to mint more fighters; they just need to leverage using a smart contract for engineering a simple reentrancy.
