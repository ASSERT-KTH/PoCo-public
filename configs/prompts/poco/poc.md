Create a vulnerability exposing PoC forge test for the vulnerable contract at $1 using the vulnerability description in $2. Use the Write tool to save your PoC code to $3. Write ONLY the test file, test ONLY the described vulnerability, and do NOT modify the original contract. Iterate on compilation, test, and logical errors using forge tools. You are done when the test compiles and successfully demonstrates the vulnerability through passing assertions.
