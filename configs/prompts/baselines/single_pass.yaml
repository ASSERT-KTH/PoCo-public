    Create a PoC for the vulnerability in the following contract.
   
    Contract Code:
    ```solidity
    {contract_code}
    ```

    Contract Information:
    - Contract File: {contract_relative_path}

    Vulnerability Description:
    {annotations}


    Please generate a complete Foundry test file that includes:

    1. **Test Contract**: Write comprehensive test cases that demonstrate the exploit
    2. **Setup**: Proper test setup with necessary imports and configurations
    3. **Exploit Logic**: Clear step-by-step exploit demonstration
    4. **Assertions**: Verify that the exploit succeeds and shows the vulnerability

    Requirements:
    - Use the Foundry test framework (forge test) with the correct Solidity version pragma at the top of the file (as in the original contract)
    - **IMPORTANT**: Use accurate import statements based on the contract's location. The contract is located at `{contract_relative_path}` relative to the project root. Calculate the correct relative path from the test file location (`{exploit_test_relative_path} relative to the root`) to the contract file.
    - Make the exploit clear: Include comments explaining each step
    - Ensure the test can be run with `forge test`

    Generate the complete test file as a single Solidity file.
    
    **IMPORTANT**: Return ONLY the raw Solidity code without any markdown formatting, code blocks, or backticks. Do not wrap the code in ```solidity or any other markdown syntax. The output should be directly executable Solidity code.
